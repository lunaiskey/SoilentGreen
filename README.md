This is a stupid project brought on due to a conversation on the purpur discord about the lack of tacos inside of servers.

Features:
  - Messages get sent to console when a Villager gets turned into Taco Meat.

You can request features if you wish, just open an issue.

KNOWN: command prompt doesn't parse the Taco Emoji. Pterodactyl does tho so thats nice.
